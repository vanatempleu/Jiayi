the version control provides us as contributors a good way to view the changes of projects like adding new improvements and features.
Since projects we upload are more like open-source projects, contributors want to and have to track changes, especially when collaborating
on projects where multiple people will be updating the same code. And version control allows project managers to locate bug and
revert code back to a previous working version more easily.
